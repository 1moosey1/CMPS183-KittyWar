## Notice

This project is based on the CMPS 115 project [Kitty War Card Game](https://github.com/brucedsu/KittyWar). We already have a working server and an iOS app. For CMPS 183, we plan to fix old bugs, add more cats, abilities and chance cards and add more functionalities such as supporting two more players battling in one game. We also plan to create a web app and an android app to play the game.

## High Level Goals

* Users are able to register their accounts, view their profiles and play the game via both the web app and mobile apps (iOS app and android app).
* The server matches multiple players (two or more players) with closing level of skill into one game.
* One server to support cross platform matches (Android, iOS, web app)
* Add more cats, abilities and chance cards.
